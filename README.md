# Data Science Project 2020
### Data Science Project for Business Intelligence &amp; Process Management Master Program at HWR Berlin

In this project, we will be tackling a supervised classification problem using the data from the Kaggle competition "[Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries)". Our task will be to classify rental listing inquiries, and predict how much interest they will receive according to three categories: Low, Medium and High.

For this project, we will be using three different models, and comparing their performance to find the best one for this specific task. The models will be:
- Regularized Linear Models
- Trees
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks

Our classification problem will be composed of various sections:
- Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Model Performance & Hyper-Parameter Tuning
- Prediction Explanation & Story Telling
